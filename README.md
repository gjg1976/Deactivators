# Deactivators
Deactivators, the classic '80 game is back 

## Gameplay
### Playing the Game
The object of the game is to remove all bombs from 5 different buildings You start on level one in a four by four building. The displays at the top of the screen provides a view of waht is going on in two adjacent rooms. At the bottom of the screen is a map of the building showing you the positions of droids and bombs. Each droid is restricted in the number of rooms it can move between. your score is shown in the box on the left, and any bonus droids you have available. The status box on the right shows whether the dorid you are controlling is carrying either a bomb or a circuit board.
To remove the bombs from the building you will have to carry them to the exit and throw them out. There is not always a direct route out of the building, so you will have to throw the bomb between a number of droids to remove it. The exit room is the only room with a dorr which leads to the outside. Certain elements in each building will not function until you replace the corresponding circuit board in the computer room. These include lights, matter transmitters and door or window openings. Some circuit boards are dummies and have no effect and others switch off obstructing forcefields.
You can move around the building in a number of different ways Through the doors, dropping through hatches, sliding up and down poles, or using the matter transporters

### Options
Once the game has loaded, you will see the opening screen. From here you will be able to select either beginner or advance level. On beginner level you will have slower guards, more time and more impacts before the bombs explode.
If you have already played the game but failed, you will be given the opportunity to restart the last level you played with a zero score.
If you manage to remove all bombs from a building, you will placed at the start of the next level.

### Selecting and controlling droid
When an new level starts, or when you press E key,  you will be placed in droid select mode. This is shown by the flashing highlight on the map. By pressing left or right arrow keys, the cursosr can be moved over all the available droids in the building. Presing the E key, take control of selected droid.
To place a bonus droid (if available), select the cursor left or right to highlight the bonus droid and press E key. A simple cursor will now appear over the top left room on the building map. Use arrow keys to position the cursor over the room in which you wish to place the bonus droid and press E. The bonus dorid will appears in the room and you will take control of it.
When in dorid movement mode, use WASD keys to move around.

### Bombs
All the bombs in a building are set to go off in a sequence. If you ara carrying an active bomb you will see the fuse burning in the status display. Be careful when throwing bombs as they can only withstand a limited number of impacts before they will explode. When throwing a bomb through a window or hatch, try and position a droid on the other side to catch it. When the bomb passes into the new room, control will automatically be transferred to the new droid.

### Replacing Circuit Boards
Circuit boards need to be replaced in the computer room to restore the functions of certain elements in the building. there is only one computer room per building. To replace a circuit board, move the droid carrying the circuit board to the back of the computer room until touch the computer, the circuit board will be unload from the droid and installed in the computer. Have fun doing this in the dark on level 4!

### Picking up and throwing objects
A dorid can only carry one object at a time. Trying to pick up a bomb whilst carrying anything else will cause the comb to explode. To pick up either a bomb or a circuit board, move your droid over it. To throw, press the fire key Q to display a trajecmeter showing the angle and direction at which the throw will be made. Move the dorid left, A, or right, D, to select the direction required, and press the Q key to throw when the angle you want to throw at is displayed.
Press the down key and the droid will drop the object carried and return you to movement control mode.
Press the up key and the droid will cancel the throw and retiurn to movement control mode.

### Robot Guards
The robot guards will only chase after an active droid if ther are in the same sector of the building. If you go out of the sector, the freeze and get back to patrol mode. Guards can be destroyed only by making them fall through hatches within a short space of time. If a guard makes contact with an active droid, the droid will disintegrate. If the droid is carrying a bomb, then the bomb will explode

### Scan Mode
In scan mode, moving with arrow keys in any of the four directions will move a cursor over the building map displaying the highlighted rooms. This mode enable you to plan your routes and keep an eye out for any guards which might be lurking in adjacent rooms. Pressing the R key will return you to the location and contorl of the currently active droid. In Building 5, no scan mode is available until one of the circuit boards is replaced in the computer.
